Hello, I am Mahin Khandker and I am a Senior at Farmingdale State College. I am majoring in Computer Science and very excited to present to you the application EduTrack. This application will allow you to keep track of all your students in one allocated location. Having a profile picture will make it easier to remember faces and all their updated information in one table.

This application helps you keep track of all your students. Every semester you meet new students and it can be hard to remember faces as well as names. However, using this application will help you save time of looking through hundreds of documents of who belongs where and shorten your workload. In addition, you can save your memory for other usefull tasks.
